# Aquamarine Swim Center DB

This website simulates a swim center database that manages class registration, class information, patron information, instructor information, emergency contact information, and pool reservations. This pool hosts 15 classes per season (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer) and also allows for reserving the space during the weekends for other events, making about $200,000 annually. The facility has 10 swimming instructors that host classes and our system will log information of about 200 patrons. It will require patrons to have an emergency contact and allow patrons to sign up for swim classes or make reservations. This database will allow for the swim center to be organized and have all the information in one place.
